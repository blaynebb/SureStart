# SureStart
Day 1 (2/8/21): I hope to learn some new methods of supervsed learning to aid in my research. This research uses a large data set gathered from shape characteristics of cancer cells. The goal is to create a predictive model for predicting metastatic behavior using shape characteristics. 

Day 2 (2/9/21): Supervised learning is when you train a computer using a well labeled data set. Unsupervised learning is when you dont need to supervise the model. Rather, you allow the model to make discoveries about the data on its own. Scikit is only responsible for doing the machine learning. It is not capable of visualizing, preparing, or manipulating data. Scikit is built upon libraries that will do these tasks.
